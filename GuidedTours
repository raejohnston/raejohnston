In-product guided tours and digital adoption platforms
If you've downloaded an app recently, you've probably seen some kind of guided tour to help you get started. They're a great way to bring assistance directly to the user, without asking them to interrupt the task at hand and potentially pre-empting support issues. If this sounds useful, you may want to consider a Digital Adoption Platform. 
# What is a Digital Adoption Platform?
A Digital Adoption Platforms (DAP) is a software solution - that provides interactive guidance and support to users while using a web application or software product. DAPs are typically low code solution that give writers the ability to add content directly to the UI, without needing a lot of development work.  
# How Digital Adoption Platforms work 
The principle of most DAPs is broadly the same. You add a snippet of Javascript to the header of your application which allows the DAP to scan what's on the page and call relevant content. Different solutions have different algorithmic approaches to 'seeing' the page, and these can be significant so if you're considering investing in one, it's important to evalute the options thoroughly. A typical DAP consists of three main components:
- An editor: used by content designers to develop and test the tours. 
- A management console, to organise and publish your tours, and manage translations. 
- An analytics console, to understand how users are interacting with tours and drive improvements. 
# Building a guided tour 
One of the benefits of a DAP is that it is quick, easy and intuitive for an author to design and build tours. You can use the editor to browse around the page, identifying elements that you might want to annotate. You'll need to think about:
- How the tour moves from one step to another. You can use a series of timed steps (frustrating for fast readers), or ask the user to click a button or complete a field, or you may just want a 'next' button that the user can click when they are ready to move on. You can use these in combination, but too many different step transitions can be disorienting for the user. 
The length and structure of each tour. If you have too many steps, users may get bored and drop off. 
# Controlling the look and feel 
You'll want your guided tour to look part of your application - that means consistent colour, typeface, button styles and so on. Different DAP vendors have a different approach to this depending on their commercial model. You may need to pay for some professional services to get everything looking as it should, but some vendors give you access to the solution's CSS files so that you can edit it yourself. 
# Challenges 
## Potential for direct interaction with production code 
The ease with which a DAP, once implemented allows you to place content in production environments is a blessing and a curse, and it's something that a lot of solutions, assuming use within relatively simple applications, don't always seem to have factored in. 






Limitations
Limited Support for Complex Workflows: DAPs may struggle to support complex workflows or processes that require manual input or involve multiple steps.

Limited Support for Mobile Apps: Some DAPs may not support mobile apps or may have limited support, making it difficult to provide consistent user experience across different devices.

Limited Support for Non-Web Applications: DAPs are designed for web applications and may not support desktop applications or other software.

Limited Analytics: DAPs may have limited analytics capabilities, making it difficult to track user behavior and identify areas for improvement.

Choosing a DAP
When choosing a DAP, there are several factors to consider:

Ease of Use: The DAP should be easy to use for both end-users and administrators. The interface should be intuitive, and the software should be easy to configure and customize.

Feature Set: The DAP should support the features that are most important to the company, such as guided tours, tooltips, and in-app messaging.

Integration: The DAP should integrate easily with existing systems and software, such as CRMs, CMSs, and marketing automation software.

Customization: The DAP should be easily customizable to match the company's branding and user experience.

Support: The DAP should provide excellent support, including documentation, tutorials, and customer service.

What to Know Before Using a DAP in Production
Before using a DAP in production, there are several things to consider:

User Experience: The DAP should provide an excellent user experience that enhances the product and does not detract from it.

User Feedback: User feedback should be solicited and used to improve
