## Guided tours
I've used a few different Digital Adoption Platforms (DAPs) to create guided tours in applications. 
Guided tours are a great way to orient and onboard the user, and DAPs are often powerful, easy to use and require very little in the way of developer effort. 
Here's an example of a guided tour created using Appcues. 
<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/378576478?h=c6a272389d&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="UA dh live video"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>
Here are some more examples of tours that I build using Newired.
