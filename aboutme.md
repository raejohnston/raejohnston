title: About me

---

Apart from the odd distraction (project manager for a major london art museum. I was terrible at it) I've been a technical writer for most of my career. 
I've written about hardware and software in a variety of settings from education to big data. In the past few years I've settled into a UX writing niche with a side order of user documentation.
