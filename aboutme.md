title: About me
---

Apart from the odd distraction (like drawing gantt charts for a major London art museum) I've been a technical writer for most of my career. 
I've written about hardware and software in a variety of settings from education to big data. 

As users change, my work has changed. I used to write 1000-page PDFS describing every screen, field and button. Now, I typically spend my time using words to make the applications themselves more usable. 

I can:
- Set up a modern content design practice from scratch, building, leading and motivating an engaged team. 
- Coach and develop junior and mid-career writers.  
- Use content to revolutionise the user experience. 
- Work with product owners, PMs, developers, researchers and designers through the entire design lifecycle. 
- Use design tools like Figma to contribute content to designs. 
- Use plugins for Figma, like Ditto and Frontitude 
- Design and conduct research
- Facilitate workshops and ideation sessions 
- Learn pretty much anything well enough to write about it.
