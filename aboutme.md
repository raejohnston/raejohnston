title: About me

---

Apart from the odd distraction (like drawing gantt charts for a major London art museum) I've been a technical writer for most of my career. 
I've written about hardware and software in a variety of settings from education to big data. 
As users change, my work has changed. I used to write large manuals describing every screen, field and button. Now I typicaly spend my time using words to make the applications themselves more usable.
