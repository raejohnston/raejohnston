##Docs as code 
Docs as code is a documentation methodology that, well, treats docs as code. That means creating, storing and managing it in the same tools as a developer would use, rather than specialised tools such as Madcap Flare. 
I built this site using Jekyll, and it's hosted for free on github.io. I'm going to document my DAC learning curve here.
