subtitle: C is for Card Sorting

Card sorting is a user experience testing methodology that we use to understand how users think about related concepts and terms. It’s often used to define the structure of a site or service, but it can also help us to understand user journeys or workflows. 
In a card sorting session, we ask the participant to group concepts together in ways that are meaningful to them. For example, for a car insurance website, users may think about how criteria such as, vehicle type, mileage, no-claims status, and so on, relate to each other. 

There are two kinds of card sorts:
- Open, where the participant adds terms they feel are important as well as arranging them. 
- Closed, where the researcher defines the terms in advance. 
You can do a card sort using only a pen and paper, Miro, or any kind of whiteboarding software, so it’s a low-cost option to use early in the process before wireframes or any kind of coding begins. However, with a large group of participants, it can be challenging to collate the results in a way that is actionable and meaningful.  This is where digital tools can help – our upcomin user testing platform, UserZoom, has a card sort analysis feature.
