An affordance is a design characteristic that suggests to the user how a particular element might be used. Affordances are everywhere in the physical world – for example, when you approach a door the placement of the hinges and the shape of the handle help you to guess whether you need to pull or push. The term ‘affordance’ was coined, or at least popularised, by Donald Norman in his book The design of everyday things.

They’re also often misplaced – how many times have you pulled at a door because the handle looked ‘pull-y’?  The phenomenon is so common that there’s a whole subreddit devoted to ‘Norman Doors’.

Thanks to r/normandoors for this particularly striking example.

In the digital world, we use affordances to make buttons look clickable, grey out options that are unavailable and generally help the user to find their way around an interface.  They’re an important way of making users feel confident and oriented in the application.

UX expert Steve Krug says it best: “As a user, I should never have to devote a millisecond of thought to whether things are clickable or not.”

Get it right and your interface is more learnable, get it wrong and users will make frustrating mistakes.
