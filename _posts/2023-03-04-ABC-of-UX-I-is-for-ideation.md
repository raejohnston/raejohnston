Title: ABC of UX
Subtitle: I is for Ideation

Ideation is the process of generating ideas – ideally without getting too much into the practical details. 
It’s a common next step after a round of usability research, where user pain points have been identified and the question is how best to address them, but you may also ideate around product enhancements and new features. 

Ideation works best when:
•	You have a diverse mix of stakeholders contributing. Different perspectives are important. 
•	All ideas are captured. You might want to come back to them, perhaps even to solve a different problem later. 
•	It’s a judgement-free zone. For now, all that matters is generating ideas, the evaluation comes later. 

There are lots of different methods that a facilitator might employ in an ideation session, for example, sketching, ‘worst idea’ (where you try to get the best solution.)
