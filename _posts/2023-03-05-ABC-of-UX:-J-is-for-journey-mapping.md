Guerilla testing (also known as hallway testing) is a quick, simple way of validating UX decisions by asking colleagues or members of the public. 

If you have a relatively simple design decision to make, chatting to 8-10 participants can often give you enough insights to move forward. Like the picture above, we see an attempt to collect real-time research by asking users to order coffee using an app called Pandora. It’s not a substitute for more extensive research protocols, but it’s lightweight and cheap.  
Guerilla research is great when:
- The hypothesis or scenario you want to test is simple. 
- You don’t need participants with specialist domain knowledge.
- You don’t have the time or resources for more structured sessions.  
If you’re working with complex scenarios or unusual personas, guerrilla testing may not be the best approach, but you may find that you can still use it for simple questions, freeing up researcher time for the trickier stuff. 
As with all UX research, you still need to prepare. 
Which means: 
- Having a hypothesis you want to validate.
- Understanding the kind of people you need to approach.
- Developing some kind of discussion guide. 
And when you’re done, the results need to be synthesised and presented back to stakeholders.
