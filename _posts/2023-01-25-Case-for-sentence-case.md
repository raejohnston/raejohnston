title: The case for sentence case 
---
Between 2010 and 2018, New York City replaced its old all-capitals street signs with sentence 
case signage (that’s only the first letter capitalised). The reason? Readability, especially when 
driving at speed, or at night. 
A group of academic and industry specialists worked with the Federal Highway Administration 
(FHWA) to develop the Clearview font. The size, shape and spacing of the letters maximises 
readability, especially for older motorists. But as well as the font itself, the FHWA mandates 
sentence case because study after study confirms that it’s quicker and easier to read. 
If you’ve worked with anyone on our UX writing team you’ll know we’re big advocates of 
sentence case – and now you know why!
