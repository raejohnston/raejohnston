 While the man himself has been the subject of online controversy recently, Don Norman’s book launched thousands of UX careers and is still relevant today.  

It’s an accessible read, because Norman uses examples not from software, but from physical items we use every day. Have you ever accidentally scalded yourself in an unfamiliar hotel shower, lit the wrong gas burner in the kitchen you’ve owned for years, or pushed a door that was meant to be pulled? You’ve been the victim of a misaligned mental model, a dodgy affordance, or a clumsy metaphor – design mistakes that we still see in the world of software all the time. 
 
For a lot of UX practitioners, the book was a lightbulb moment – a realisation that caring about all this stuff could be your actual job, and that design was more than colours, fonts and white space. 
 
A great quote:
 
“Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.”
